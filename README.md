# British Airlines (BA) Project

This is a project task for a virtual internship with British Airways, powered by Forage.

I am using British Airways (BA) dataset that I found in their website.

I intend to use my analytical skills to influence real-life multi-million-pound decisions right from day one, thus making a tangible impact on the business. As I provide recommendations, tools and models, they will drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.

Customers who book a flight with British Airways (BA) engage with the airline brand through many touchpoints. Therefore, it is imperative for any business, including BA, to understand their customers' feelings, needs, and feedback.

The first task at hand is to focus on scraping and collecting customer feedback, and reviewing data from a third-party source. I will then analyze this data to uncover any insights that I may find and present them accordingly.

The second task is to build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behavior.
